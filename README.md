## Business Problem & Key Questions

The primary business problem addressed in this project is the need for a detailed analysis of the coffee shop's data. Key questions include:

1. What is the total revenue generated by different types of coffee (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta)?
2. How does sales performance vary over time?
3. What are the sales patterns by country?
4. Who are the top four customers contributing to the revenue?

## Approach

The project followed a structured approach:

1. **Data Duplication:**
   - Created duplicate sheets for source data (orders, customers, products).

2. **Data Population:**
   - Populated missing customer and product information in the orders sheet.

3. **Data Enrichment:**
   - Created new columns for full names of coffee and roast types for clarity.

4. **Data Formatting:**
   - Converted the dataset into a table with formatted styles (color, font, column width).
   - Formatted sales and unit price fields into currency and numeric formats.
   - Adjusted date format to (dd-mmm-yyyy).

5. **Analysis:**
   - Utilized pivot tables to analyze total revenue by coffee type, total sales over time, sales by country, and top four customers.

6. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Visualized analysis results using donut charts, bar charts, and time series analysis.
   - Implemented slicers for interactive dashboard exploration.

## Data Cleaning

- Cleaned missing or inconsistent data in the orders, customers, and products sheets.
- Standardized coffee and roast type abbreviations for consistency.

## Data Preparation

- Enriched the dataset by creating new columns for full names of coffee and roast types.
